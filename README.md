Thanks for playing this game!  I don't believe in psyichics, but this is a fun way to learn how the user input can be used to interact with the html page via logic in javascript.

To play, simply press an alphabet key on your keyboard once the page is loaded.  The computer has randomly chosen an alphabet character as well, and you get 9 tries to guess the right one.  An alert will let you know when you've won or lost, and the page will keep tally of your score.
