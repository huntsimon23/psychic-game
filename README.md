# psychic-game

Thanks for playing this game!  I don't believe in psyichics, but this is a fun way to learn how the user input can be used to interact with the html page via logic in javascript.  This is my first ever javascript project and I did it in about 6 hours.  I will get faster with time.

To play, simply press an alphabet key on your keyboard once the page is loaded.  The computer has randomly chosen an alphabet character as well, and you get 9 tries to guess the rught one.  An alert will let you know when you've won or lost, and the page will keep tally of your score.  

If you'd like to see some of my other projects, check them out on my portfolio site:
